# THΞ DOMINION

This is not a finished idea.  
This is not a startup.  
This is just a call.

A call to coders, designers, thinkers, rebels, and builders.  
If you feel like you don’t belong anywhere else... maybe you belong here.

We don’t know yet what we’ll build.  
But we’ll build something. Together.
